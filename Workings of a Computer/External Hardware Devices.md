# External Hardware Devices #

We will learn:

- How a digital camera works
- How a barcode reader works
- How RFID works
- How a laser printer works
- How magnetic, solid state and optical discs work
- The applications of each of these devices
(digital cameras tend to work with either CCDs or CMOS (Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor))
- There are an enormous range of devices available for computer systems.
- We concentrate on those devices that are stipulated in the specification.
- We must understand the main characteristics, purposes, suitability and principles of:
    - Digital camera
    - Barcode reader
    - Laser printer
    - RFID
- A digital camera is a device for recording still and moving images in digital form that can then be processed further using specialised software.
- In common with other devices, the camera is taking analogue data, in this case light waves, and converting them into binary (1s and 0s).
- When a photograph is taken the shutter opens and lets light in through the lens.
- The light is focused onto a sensor, which is usually a either a CCD (charged coupled device) or a a CMOS (Complementary metal oxide semiconductor).
- The sensors are made up of millions of transistors, each which stores the data for one or more pixels.
- A pixel is a picture element or individual dot, where the whole image will be made of millions of pixels.
- As the light hits the sensor, it is converted into electrons and the amount of charge is recorded for each pixel in digital form.
- With light, all colours can be created from red, green and blue (RGB). In order to record colour, colour, the camera will either have three different sensors that all capture an individual colour, colour, or use three different filters -one for red, one for green, one for blue.
- The data is typically stored onto removable devices, usually on flash memory, which uses EEPROM as described later under the SSD section.
- Data is usually stored in compressed files, for example, TIFF, JPG, or PNG.
- RAW files can also be generated, which are uncompressed and contain all of the data from the original photograph.
- This digital data can now be decoded and manipulated using specialised software.
- A light, usually an LED or laser, is passed over an image.
- Some form of light sensor is used to measure the intensity of light being reflected back. This is converted into a current effectively generating a waveform. This could be achieved using a photodiode or a CCD sensor in the same way as a digital camera.
- White areas reflect the most light and black areas the least, making it possible to use the waveform to distinguish the patterns of black and white bars.
- A waveform is analogue and therefore needs to be converted into digital form using an analogue to digital converter.
- The encoder will convert the black and white into binary codes, eg. Black = 0 white = 1.
- The signal is decoded into a form that can then be interpreted by software.
- There are many different types of barcode.
- Perhaps the most common is the UPC (universal product code) barcode, which uses a series of black and white lines of different widths with a printed number underneath.
- Bar codes are used primarily for inputting product details at the point of sale.
- Typical uses include food, electrical products and books.
- More recently, the same technology has been applied to codes that are made up of blocks of black and white symbols rather than lines.
- One example is the QR code, which has been widely adopted as it can be read with a scanner embedded within a smartphone and can contain a wider range of information than a barcode.
- Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technique where small wireless tracking devices or tags are embedded onto or into other items.
- The tags, which are typically about the size of a grain of rice, can be attached to almost anything and will contain data about the item being tracked.
- Typical uses include tagging pets or livestock, or tracking products through a production line.
- RFID is being used in retail environments to tag products or to enable customer payments.
