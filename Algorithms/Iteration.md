# Iteration #

- Iteration means repetition
- A sequence of instructions is repeated multiple times
- This is much more efficient than writing the instructions multiple times
- The number of repetitions needed may vary, and may not be known when writing the code
- There are three types of loop: WHILE, REPEAT, and FOR

------------

- A WHILE loop is a conditional loop. The condition is tested upon entry to the loop.
- If the condition is met, the code in the loop will be executed until it is not met.
- If it is not met, the code in the loop will be skipped.
