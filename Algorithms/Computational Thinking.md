# Computational Thinking #

LO:

- Explore different strategies for problem-solving
- Develop and check solutions to logic problems

Computational thinking is working out how to work things out. It is the ability to think logically about a problem and apply techniques for solving it. It is closely related to the skill of designing algorithms which can be turned into computer programs.

"Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviour by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science."

Simulation is the process of designing a model of a real system in order to understand the behaviour of the system, and to evaluate various strategies for its operation.

Simulations include:

- Financial risk analysis
- Amusement park rides
- Population predictions
- Managing inventory systems
- Queuing problems

**Simulation of Queues**

A queuing system is described by:

- Arrival rate
- Time between arrivals
- Number of servers
- Service time

A stable system has an arrival rate < service rate.
