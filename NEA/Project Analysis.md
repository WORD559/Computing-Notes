## Feasibility Study ##

- Technologically - Are you able to actually code this?
- Economically - Would the organisation be able to afford this? What will they get back from this?
- Legally - Is it legal to do this?
- Organisationally - Can the group you are writing the project for cope with the new system?
- Schedule - Will you be able to get it done in time?

------------------

- What is the current system? How does the end user interact with the system? 
- What are the problems with this system?
- What are the possible solutions? What MUST this system do? What compatibility must this have? What OS should it run on?
- What are the problems with these solutions?

There are acceptable limitations here - a proof of concept is allowed. For example, a project may not use actual student data but test data to prove it works.


Objectives must be SMART:

 - Specific
 - Measurable
 - Achievable
 - Realistic
 - Timed
