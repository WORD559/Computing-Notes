# Morals vs Ethics #

Morals concern your own behaviour. They are the way that you think you should conduct yourself.

Ethics are a set of moral values that society decides you must live by.

## Computer Misuse Act ##

Old, out of date, but still applies.

This has three levels.

1. Attempting to gain unauthorised access.
2. Attempting to gain unauthorised access with a malicious intent.
3. Actually gaining access to the system.

There is also a fourth part of the act, which makes it illegal to distribute software that is likely to be used to break the Computer Misuse Act.
