## Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks ##

A patent is protection of an idea, which allows a party to protect their idea so that it cannot be stolen before they are able to manufacture and profit from it.

A copyright protects the actual product from being copied and sold on, to ensure that the person who created it (or at least, the person who holds the copyright) gets money for it.

A trademark allows a company to protect the right to its iconic features that essentially brand the material they produce.
