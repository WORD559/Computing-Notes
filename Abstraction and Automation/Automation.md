- In this context, it refers to building models of real world objects or phenomena in order to solve a particular problem.
- Computer scientists have to decide what details are relevant to the problem and discard everything else.
- Algorithms and data structures can then be designed to solve the problem
- The algorithm is then implemented in program code and executed
- An example of a model is a financial year prediction
- You could attempt to predict how well your coffee shop will do this year based on previous years and the current environment
