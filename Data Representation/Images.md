# Images #

There are two main options for images - bitmaps (raster) and vectors.

Bitmaps are the standard method - pixels. Pixels are a good standard way of doing it, but if you try and enlarge a small bitmap image, it becomes really pixelated and you lose quality. 

Vectors, however, are different. The file size is typically much smaller and quality is not affected by enlarging. They are made by using equations to calculate where the lines/drawings can be. The edges of vector drawings are often much smoother, and organising, editing and manipulating shapes is considerably easier.
