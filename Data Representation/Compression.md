# Compression #

- The desire to reduce file size
- Why bother?
- How does it work?

## Method 1 - Lossless ##

Lossless compression uses special algorithms to reduce the file size in such a way that, at the other end, the file can be decompressed in such a way that all of the original bits from the original file can be acquired. 

If you wanted to compress music, you could use lossy, because data that most people have no interest in (for example, remove the pitches above the range of human hearing, or reduce the sample rate) to get something "close enough" but not the same.

## Method 2 - Lossy ##

Lossy compression produces an output file that is close enough to the original that most people won't be able to tell the difference.

If you wanted to compress program code, you would want to use lossless, otherwise you'd lose half the code at the other end.
