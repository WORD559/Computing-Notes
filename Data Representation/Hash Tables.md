# Hash Tables #

We can have an unsorted list, but still optimise searching it.

If we are looking for a specific value, we can use hash algorithms to specify the location of the data.
The hash defines the location, and we can calculate the hash from the data.

A good hashing algorithm maximises the number of unique hashes.


A problem with a hash table is that it can take up a large amount of memory by requiring you to preset the amount of data you can take.
