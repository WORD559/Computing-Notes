==Creating a table==

CREATE TABLE tblProduct
(
ProductID CHAR(4) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
Description VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
Price CURRENCY
)

The datatypes must be explicity stated. Things like "NOT NULL" make a field non-optional, and "PRIMARY KEY" makes it the primary key.

Common datatypes include:

 - CHAR(n) : Character string of fixed length n
 - VARCHAR(n) : Character string of variable length, max length n
 - BOOLEAN : TRUE or FALSE
 - INTEGER, INT : Integer
 - FLOAT(n,d) : Floating point with maximum number of digits n and d numbers after the decimal point
 - DATE : Day, month, year
 - TIME : Hour, minute, second
 - CURRENCY: Formats numbers for the currency in your region

==Altering a table==

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

To add a new column:

ALTER TABLE tblProduct
ADD QtyInStock

To delete a column:

ALTER TABLE tblProduct
DROP QtyInStock

To change the datatype:

ALTER TABLE tblProduct
MODIFY COLUMN QtyInStock FLOAT(10,2) NOT NULL

==Data==

INSERT INTO is used to insert a new record into a table.

If we had, for example:

ProductID CHAR(4) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
Description VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
Price CURRENCY

We would do:

INSERT INTO tblProduct (ProductID,Description,Price) VALUES ("A345","Pink Rabbit",7.50)

You don't need to specify the field names if you are adding data to all fields in order.


You use UPDATE to modify records.

UPDATE tblProduct
SET Description = "Red Rabbit"
WHERE ProductID = "A345"


DELETE FROM is used to delete a record in a table.

E.g.:
DELETE FROM Product
WHERE ProductID = "A345"

This would delete the record with primary key "A345".
